Conways Game of Life

Written during the first part of quarantine April 2020.

The only requirements are python3 and pyglet.
pip install pyglet.

Be sure to have the covid-19 images in the source folder.
Code is commented heavily so it should be pretty easy to follow.
I've never used pyglet before so...
